# COVID Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 from medical images such as X-rays or CT scans. The goal is to provide an efficient and automated tool to aid in the early diagnosis of COVID-19.

- **data/**: Directory containing medical images organized into training, validation, and test sets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model experimentation.
- **src/**: Source code for data preprocessing, model definition, and utility functions.
- **requirements.txt**: File listing the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **README.md**: This file.
- **main.py**: Main script for running the training and evaluation pipeline.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV

You can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID_Detection_CNN.git
   cd COVID_Detection_CNN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Data**

   Ensure that you have your medical images organized in the `data/` directory according to the structure mentioned above. You may need to preprocess these images to match the input requirements of the CNN model.

## Training the Model

To train the CNN model, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --train
```

This will start the training process using the images in the `data/train/` directory and validate the model using the `data/val/` directory.

## Evaluation

After training, you can evaluate the model on the test set:

```bash
python main.py --evaluate
```

The model will generate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the images in the `data/test/` directory.

## Usage

Once trained, you can use the model to make predictions on new medical images. For example:

```python
from src.model import load_model, predict_image

model = load_model('path/to/saved/model.h5')
prediction = predict_image('path/to/new/image.jpg', model)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
```

## Results

Provide a summary of your model's performance here. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You might also want to include some example predictions and comparisons with ground truth.
